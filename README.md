This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Design 
I have used React-icons for all the icons in this website.

I have used tailwind css for styling the components. 

I use getStaticProps to generate a static page on build time using next js SSG.

I have added theme toggle using localStorage to store the themes and custom hook called useTheme is used to abstract the logic.
